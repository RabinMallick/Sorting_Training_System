President of Democratic Republic of Potatostan has established a People Sorting Department.
To train smart and valuable civil servants for this job, you need to create a Sorting Training system.
It needs to work this way:
After clicking "Start sorting", show a modal where its possible to enter a number of people to add to the list.
The modal window needs to accept a number between 20 and 100.
After clicking Start, generate the provided number of people, add them to the table as separate entries, and start a timer.
Each entry has a random email, a number of potatoes that this person has (must be unique) and a random name.
The user has to drag and drop the rows from the most potatoes at the top to the least potatoes at the bottom.
After the list is sorted in the correct order, stop the timer and show a success message with his score.

```
